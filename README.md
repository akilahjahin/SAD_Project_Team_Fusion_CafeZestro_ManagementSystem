# For Frontend

3. **Cloning repository**
Open Folder (new)
Open the folder in cmd/ git bash
Clone command:  **git clone <repo -url>**
**If a problem arises, just pull contents from the master branch since the feature/add-login functionality branch has the backend codes only, but incomplete, whereas the master branch contains all files.
Then, the repository cloned to the specific folder.** <br>
** Add the .env file** (if not added) in the backend folder or modify (if present in backend already) : <br> Within it, adjust the database password; also correct the email, pass into an organizational one (e.g. iut-mail and password) <br>
Open the files in a workspace in VS Code <br>

Follow the terminal instructions of ‘Ctrl+link’ afterwords**
5. **In the backend terminal, write ‘npm i’ only once and never again, this creates the node-modules for the backend. Then write: ‘npm start’ , always whenever you want to turn on the system anew.**
