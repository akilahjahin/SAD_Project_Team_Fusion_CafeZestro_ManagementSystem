# For Frontend
1. Open new terminal.
2. ```cd frontend```
3. ```npm i``` (One time if not installed before)
4. ```npm run dev```

# For Backend
1. Open new terminal.
2. ```cd backend```
3. Add your `.env` inside backend.
4. ```npm i``` (One time if not installed before)
5. ```npm start```

# NOTE:
1. Install ```node.js, next.js, react@bootstrap``` VSCode
2. Install necessary extensions for **react.js, next.js, node.js, tailwind.css**
3. **Cloning repository**
Open Folder (new)
Open the folder in cmd/ git bash
Clone command:  **git clone <repo -url>**
**If a problem arises, just pull contents from the master branch since the feature/add-login functionality branch has the backend codes only, but incomplete, whereas the master branch contains all files.
Then, the repository cloned to the specific folder.** <br>
** Add the .env file** (if not added) in the backend folder or modify (if present in backend already) : <br> Within it, adjust the database password; also correct the email, pass into an organizational one (e.g. iut-mail and password) <br>
Open the files in a workspace in VS Code <br>
4. **In the frontend terminal, write ‘npm i’ only once and never again, this creates the node-modules for the frontend. Then write: ‘npm run dev’, always whenever you want to turn on the system anew. 
Follow the terminal instructions of ‘Ctrl+link’ afterwords**
5. **In the backend terminal, write ‘npm i’ only once and never again, this creates the node-modules for the backend. Then write: ‘npm start’ , always whenever you want to turn on the system anew.**

**If 'npm i' not run once (and only once after each new user clones the repository) as per above instructions, node-modules won't be created.**
**If the .env file isn't there, built one as per the given image**
